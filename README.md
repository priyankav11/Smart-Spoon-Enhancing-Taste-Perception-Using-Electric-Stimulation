# Smart-Spoon-Enhancing-Taste-Perception-Using-Electric-Stimulation
Smart Spoon enhances taste perception using low-voltage electric stimulation. Designed for people with dietary restrictions, it simulates salty or sour flavors without additives. A machine learning model personalizes stimulation for each user.
🔍 Problem Addressed
Patients undergoing chemotherapy, diabetics, and individuals with taste loss often struggle with bland food. This impacts their appetite, nutrition, and quality of life. Smart Spoon offers a safe, non-invasive way to simulate flavors using electrical signals.

⚙️ How It Works
Delivers controlled electric pulses (0.5V–1.2V) through electrodes embedded in the spoon tip.

Stimulates taste receptors on the tongue to mimic desired flavors.

Integrates a machine learning model to personalize stimulation based on user feedback.

🧠 Technologies Used
Arduino Nano – For hardware control

Conductive Electrodes – For delivering electrical pulses

Python & ML Models – For personalization based on feedback
